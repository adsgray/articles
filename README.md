# articles
* zip files of articles I may or may not eventually read
* created by fetcharticle.sh and ziparticles.sh in my [scripts repository](https://github.com/adsgray/scripts/tree/master/bash)
* like [QWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWK_(file_format))
* I can e-mail the zip file to myself and the iOS gmail app let's me view the text files directly!
